By having helped one of my friends to set up a personal webside, I found it's interesting and decided to use GitHub Pages to host my own site. That way I wouldn't have to buy a domain and a server and could write my own blog.

While doing some research up on GitHub Pages, I accidentally chanced upon this _simple, blog-aware, static site generator_ called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which works really well with GitHub Pages. I figured it would do just fine for my blog and I set about searching for a pretty theme. I wanted a theme with a _book-ish_ vibe. Eventually, With the help of the theme **Tale**, I was able to build my blog.
