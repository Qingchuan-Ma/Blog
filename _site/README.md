## Features
- Compatible with GitHub Pages
- Responsive design (looks just as good on mobile)
- Syntax highlighting, with the help of Pygments
- Markdown and HTML text formatting
- Pagination of posts
- Support for MathJax and Latex

## Usage
### 1. Fork and Clone
Fork this theme then clone it.

### 2. Install dependencies
Blog uses Jekyll's built-SCSS compiler to generate CSS. I installed the Jekyll gem:

```bash
$ gem install jekyll
```

### 3. Create site
Edit the `_config.yml` file to suit my site. Also replace posts and content with my own.

### 4. Running Locally
To test my site locally, run this in my site's root directory

```bash
$ jekyll serve --watch
```

Head to http://localhost:4000 to see my site in action.
